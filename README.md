## Description
This repository is where we develop the Traveler's Top 5 application. We ([Alfonso James](https://github.com/AlfonsoJames), [Gabriella Miller-Eakin](https://github.com/gabriellamiller-eakin), [Caitlin Crews](https://github.com/caitlincrews08), [Benjamin Phan](https://github.com/bphan94), and [Nathan Anthony](https://github.com/Pegasoos)) built this application to help people conveniently find the five best reviewed locations and activities in a given city.


Traveler's Top 5 is a mobile first web application that utilizes the Yelp API to help users discover top-rated activities within a given city. The application also utilizes the Google Map Embed API to give users a map display of the selected venue.
